# Likelihood_of_Forest_Fire
* Predicted the likelihood of a Forest Fire using Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, and Linear SVC.
* Accuracy Score for Logistic Regression and Linear SVC is 100%
* Accuracy Score for Naive Bayes is 84.51%. 
  *The accuracy for Naive Bayes is less than the other two machine learning algorithms because Niave Bayes assumes that the variables in the data are independent. Here, we can see temperature, humidity, and oxygen, these three features are dependent. 
* Hence, given any new data about a forest area we can either use Logistic Regression or Linear SVC to predict the likelihood of a forest fire.
